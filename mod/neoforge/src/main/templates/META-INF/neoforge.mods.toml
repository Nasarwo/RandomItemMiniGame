LootRush is a competitive “scavenge race” mini-game that keeps every round tense from the first second to the final grab. Players are scattered to safe random locations, a target item is announced, and the hunt begins: be the first to obtain it - or outlast everyone else, remember that players switch places every 5 minutes. To keep the pace high and the round fair, LootRush adds a lives system (with automatic spectator handling), a clean scoreboard with a running timer, and periodic random position swaps with warnings so nobody can camp the same spot forever. Teleportation is built for real servers: chunks are preloaded, progress is shown via BossBar, and players receive a short invulnerability window after being moved.
